## The Game

- Race with your friends (up to 1000 players)
- Drive with the Android/Iphone app or the 3D printed remote
- Watch real time score boards and lap times: each car has a sensor that detect specially designed gates.
- Re-program the Arduino core inside each car to unlock new features from the community

## The Arduino code

If you purchased a 3Racers Pilot, you'll find it already programmed with the standard RacerOS code (Arduino-compatible).

However, if you created your own 3DRacers Pilot variation, or you want to modify the Arduino code, go to the

[Lib3DRacers repository] and download the code from there.

# The proto shield

3DRacers Pilot boards support shields, like a standard Arduino. The proto shield is the simpliest shield, that allows soldering of trought-hole components or connectors, but you can use the Eagle file as a template to create your own shield.
